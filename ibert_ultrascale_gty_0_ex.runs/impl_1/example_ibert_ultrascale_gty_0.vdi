Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
ERROR: [Place 30-681] Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. As a workaround for this error, please insert a BUFG in between the IO and the MMCM. 
	gty_sysclkp_i_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y101
	dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/USE_DIVIDER.ULTRASCALEPLUS.U_GT_MMCM (MMCME4_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCM_X0Y4

	The above error could possibly be related to other connected instances. Following is a list of 
	all the related clock rules and their respective instances.

	Clock Rule: rule_bufgce_bufg_conflict
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: Only one of the 2 available sites (BUFGCE or BUFGCE_DIV/BUFGCTRL) in a pair can be
	used at the same time
	dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/USE_DIVIDER.BUFG_inst_div (BUFGCE.O) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCE_X0Y103


	Clock Rule: rule_mmcm_bufg
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: A MMCM driving a BUFG must be placed in the same clock region of the device as the
	BUFG
	dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/USE_DIVIDER.ULTRASCALEPLUS.U_GT_MMCM (MMCME4_ADV.CLKOUT0) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCM_X0Y4
	dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/USE_DIVIDER.BUFG_inst_div (BUFGCE.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCE_X0Y103

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the GCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays. For a workaround, please insert a BUFG on the GCIO-MMCM path.
